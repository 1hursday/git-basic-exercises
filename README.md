More commits!
So, the command nano filename opens the file in a text editor to allow me to make some changes? 
Then cat filename prints whatever changes I made to my console? That's so cool!

So, I after make these changes with nano I must re-stage the file before commiting? 
I just saved then with cntrl x, y and enter and called git commmit with a cute little message there but when i git logged, all i could see was my initial commit.
I'm glad I learned that early.
